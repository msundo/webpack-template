## Getting Started
#### Pre-dependencies
Every command here should be executed in a [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) context and requires having the [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed globally.
#### Start development
1. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn install
```
2. Start local webserver
```sh
yarn dev
```
That's it! ðŸ™Œ

##  Build

To generate a production build, run the command:
```sh
yarn build
```
 â€” this will install the latest dependencies and build the project, minify scripts and stylesheets and [generally optimize](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/) the solution for production.

The output folder is `./dist`.

The following scripts and stylesheets will be generated:
* `polyfills.js`
* `main.js`
* `main.css`

other assets, such as images, will be output to the `/assets` folder.
